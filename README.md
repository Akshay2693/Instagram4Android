This library directly talks to the private Instagram API, anything (well quite a lot) you can do on the IG app you can replicate with this library.  You also bypass the public API's rate limits. 

## Credit
This is a port of a popular [Java repository](https://github.com/brunocvcunha/instagram4j) that provides access to Instagrams' private API.  This has been changed around to use OkHttp and various other fixes have been made to make it work with Android.  I will be updating this with more endpoints and so on as time goes on.

## Fair Use
Do NOT use this to spam anyone at all.
